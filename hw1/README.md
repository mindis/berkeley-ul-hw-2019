### 1. Warmup

See:

```
warmup.py
```

See figures/1_1 for plots.

The model probabilities align well when plotted against the data.
The sample empirical frequencies are similar in distribution shape but with the 
mean of the peaks slightly misaligned, this offset reduces with more samples.


### 2. Two-Dimensional Data

See:

```
two_dimensional_data.py
mlp_model.py
MADE.py
```

See figures/1_2 for plots.

Both seem to overfit. 
But both have empirical distributions that match the training distribution.
